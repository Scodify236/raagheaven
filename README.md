## WHY / The story of Raag Heaven with [Shashwat](https://github.com/Scodify236)
- I was an avid [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) user back in 2021, which I used for background playback.
- I noticed it wasn't able to stream under low network conditions.
- So i decided to create an [issue](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/5838).
- Upon finding no active resolution on the issue, I took it to myself and created this project on Jan 2022.
